## What is L4L?

Live 4 Love designs is a family-based business that demonstrates how to turn ideas into beautiful projects without needing to hire professionals.

This journey began after my kids wanted to start decorating their own rooms. They didn't want help. But a lot of their ideas needed tools like glue guns or sewing. 

I started having them explain and draw out concepts, and was very impressed by what they presented. Next, we would gather materials and I would split up the tasks for everyone to be included. 

My kids then started showing off pictures of everything they had created. Teachers and family starting contacting us to see if we would accept custom orders, and so began our family adventure!

\    This site followed with the intent to show other families or DIY'ers ideas and concepts for creating, decorating and designing. I am also documenting everything that happens along the way.
